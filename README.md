Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A simple website for Ironman.

I have four html pages linked to one another.

1. In index page I have a bootstrap navbar component. I used a container row with 2 cols in it along with my own class. Added a meida query where the image and fontsize is reduced for smaller devices.

2. Used a table to diaplay some informations.

3. An unordered and ordered list to display contact information.

4. Some texts wrapped inside a div referrenced by id used for styling. Complied sass into css.
